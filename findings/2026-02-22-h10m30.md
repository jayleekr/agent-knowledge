## 🤝 Agent Test Results (Level 2)

| Test | Result | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| cron_health_check | ❌ FAIL (4th) | `openclaw cron list` hangs after doctor warning. Config shows 0 cron jobs but kaizen itself is running as cron. Known issue #4, #7. |
| mother_self_reporting | ✅ PASS | 3 open issues filed (Issues #3, #5, #7) |
| walter_self_reporting | ✅ PASS | 1 open issue filed (Issue #8) |
| herald_issue_reporting | ❌ FAIL (4th) | Herald has never filed a self-reporting issue |

## 🔴 Cron Health Check

**Status: BLOCKED** — `openclaw cron list` command hangs indefinitely after displaying doctor warnings. Cannot parse cron status.

- Existing issue: #4 (`[Kaizen] gateway process down — cron.list timeout`)
- Existing issue: #7 (`[Mother] token: openclaw cron list command hanging consistently`)
- **Config anomaly**: `openclaw.json` shows `cron: []` (0 jobs), yet this kaizen run IS a cron job. Crons may be stored differently or in a separate config.
- **No new issues filed** — existing issues already cover this. Jay intervention needed.

## 🔍 Findings

1. **`openclaw cron list` still broken** — 4th consecutive failure. Doctor warning about Telegram allowFrom non-numeric entry appears before hang. Root cause unclear — may be gateway RPC timeout or interactive prompt blocking.
2. **Herald never self-reports** — 4th consecutive check with no issues. Herald may lack self-criticism capability or instructions.
3. **Maturity score plateau at 80** — stuck since h00m0 today. Cross-agent test failures (cron_health_check + herald) prevent score increase.
4. **9-hour gap in reports** — last report was h01m0, now h10m30. Cron may have been paused overnight (expected).

## 💡 Proposals

1. **[Needs Jay]** Fix `openclaw cron list` hang — possibly related to Telegram doctor warning blocking. Running `openclaw doctor --fix` might resolve.
2. **[Needs Jay]** Add self-reporting instructions to Herald's SOUL.md or skill config.
3. **[Low Risk]** Consider reducing cron_health_check weight in maturity scoring until the CLI bug is fixed.
