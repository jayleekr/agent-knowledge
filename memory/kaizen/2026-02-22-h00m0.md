| cron_health_check | ❌ BLOCKED | Gateway process not running — `openclaw cron list` times out after 30s |
| mother_heartbeat | ⚠️ Unknown | Cannot verify without gateway |
| mother_memory_current | ❌ | No `memory/2026-02-22.md` yet (00:16 KST, acceptable) |

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Gateway Down

**`openclaw cron list` fails — gateway process not running.**

- `pgrep -f 'openclaw.*gateway'` → no process found
- All 3 attempts timed out at 30s
- Filed **Issue #4**: [Kaizen] gateway process down — cron.list timeout
- Existing **Issue #2** (4 cron errors) cannot be re-verified

This blocks ALL cron health monitoring. Escalation: needs-jay.

## 🔍 Findings

1. **Gateway down** (priority:urgent) — Root cause unknown. Could be crash, manual stop, or system restart. Issue #4 filed.
2. **Issue #2 still open** — 4 cron jobs had errors (whatsapp unsupported, announce delivery failures). Cannot re-check status.
3. **Issue #3 still open** — Mother's token-usage tracker bug (self-reported by Mother ✅)
4. **Walter/Herald never self-reported** — Neither agent has filed any GitHub issues. This suggests self-reporting may not be implemented for them yet.

## 📊 Maturity Score: 80/100 (Level 2)

Score breakdown:
- L1 self-test pass rate: 40/40 (all pass)
- Issue resolution rate: 10/20 (2 of 4 issues still open, but they need Jay)
- Report quality: 18/20
- Eval criteria evolution: 5/10
- No regression: 7/10 (gateway down is a regression in monitoring capability)

Score dropped 84→80 due to gateway being down blocking cron checks.

## 🎫 Issue Triage
- **#2** OPEN — 4 cron errors (needs-jay)
- **#3** OPEN — Mother token tracker bug (agent:mother)
- **#4** NEW — Gateway process down (priority:urgent, needs-jay)

## 💡 Proposals
- Add gateway health check to Kaizen self-tests (auto-detectable)
- Consider filing issues for Walter/Herald to implement self-reporting
- Investigate launchd keepalive for gateway process
