## 🔴 Gateway Still Down

Gateway process not running (confirmed via pgrep). Same as h00m0 run.

**Root cause identified**: Issue #5 filed by Mother — she added a bad `agents.list[].auth` key to config, which crashed the gateway. This explains why the gateway went down.

`openclaw cron list` skipped (known timeout — no point burning 30s).

## 🔍 Findings

1. **Root cause found for gateway crash** — Mother's Issue #5 self-reports that she added an invalid key to openclaw.json causing gateway crash. Good self-reporting by Mother! ✅
2. **4 open issues**: #2 (cron errors), #3 (Mother token tracker), #4 (gateway down), #5 (Mother gateway crash cause)
3. **Walter & Herald still have zero self-reports** — need to check if they have the capability

## 📊 Maturity Score: 80/100 (Level 2)

No change from h00m0 — gateway still blocking cron checks. Score holds at 80.
