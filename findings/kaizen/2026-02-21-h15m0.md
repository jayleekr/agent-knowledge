## 📊 Collection Summary
- **Discord #content-pipeline**: No new activity (weekend)
- **Agent Sessions**: Only Kaizen cron active in last 24h
- **GitHub Issues**: 0 open
- **Mother heartbeat**: Never run (lastHeartbeat: null) ⚠️
- **Today's memory**: HypeProof project completed, bonus improvement phase

## 🧪 Self-Test Results (Level 1)

## 🤝 Agent Test Results (Level 2 — FIRST RUN)

| Agent | Test | Result | Detail |
|-------|------|--------|--------|
| Mother | mother_cron_health | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Only Kaizen cron running; weekend expected |
| Mother | mother_heartbeat_active | ❌ FAIL | heartbeat-state.json shows lastHeartbeat: null |
| Mother | mother_memory_current | ✅ PASS | memory/2026-02-21.md exists with content |
| Walter | walter_session_health | ⏭️ SKIP | Weekend — no weekday sessions expected |
| Walter | walter_github_tracker | ⏭️ SKIP | Weekend — no daily tracking expected |
| Herald | herald_session_health | ✅ PASS | Last message 2026-02-20 (active before weekend) |

**Level 2 results: 2 PASS, 1 FAIL, 1 PARTIAL, 2 SKIP**

### ⚠️ Finding: Mother Heartbeat Never Activated
- `heartbeat-state.json` has `lastHeartbeat: null` — heartbeat has never run
- All lastChecks are null (email, calendar, weather, etc.)
- This means Mother has never performed proactive checks
- **Severity: Medium** — proactive monitoring not functioning
- **Auto-fix: No** — requires investigation into heartbeat cron config

## 🔍 Findings
1. **🆙 Level 2 promotion approved by Jay!** First cross-agent test run.
2. **Mother heartbeat inactive** — needs investigation
3. **Weekend low activity** — Walter/Herald skipped appropriately

## 💡 Proposals
1. Investigate why Mother heartbeat has never fired (cron config issue?)
2. Consider filing GitHub issue for heartbeat gap

## ✅ Auto-Applied
- Updated level to 2 in self-test-results.json
- Updated maturity-history.json with Level 2 entry

## ⏳ Pending Jay's Approval
1. Herald SOUL.md `author` → `creator` fix (carried)

## 📈 Trends
- h11: 72 → h11m30: 75 → h12m0: 78 → h12m30: 80 → h13m0-h14m30: 82 → **h15m0: 82 (Level 2!)**

## 📊 Maturity Score: 82/100 (Level 2 🎉)

Now scoring with Level 2 criteria:
- agent_test_pass_rate: 2/4 (excl skips) × 0.4 = **20**
- cross_issue_resolution: 0 issues yet × 0.25 = **0**
- agent_health_monitoring: Active, first run × 0.2 = **10**
- false_positive_rate: No false positives × 0.15 = **15**
- **Level 2 sub-score: 45/100** (baseline, first run)
