**All 7/7 tests passed. Consecutive all-pass runs: 1/5**

## 🔍 Findings

1. **run.sh hangs on `claude --print`** ⚠️
   - The script delegates all work to a `claude --print` subprocess which timed out (SIGTERM after ~60s)
   - This is likely because `claude --print --max-turns 25` with a massive prompt takes too long or hangs
   - The Kaizen tests were run directly by the cron-invoked agent instead
   - **Impact: Medium** — script architecture needs rethinking

2. **Previous report findings still open**
   - Herald `author` vs `creator` field issue from 2026-02-20 still unresolved
   - Pin message fragmentation still unresolved
   - Both need Jay's approval

3. **Low activity weekend**
   - Saturday — no creator submissions expected
   - Walter/Herald idle — normal for weekend

## 💡 Proposals

1. **Refactor run.sh** — Remove `claude --print` delegation. Since Kaizen runs as a cron job that already invokes an agent, the script should just set up directories and let the cron agent do the analysis directly. The current architecture double-invokes Claude unnecessarily.

2. **Carry forward from 2026-02-20**: Herald SOUL.md `author` → `creator` fix still pending Jay approval.

## ✅ Auto-Applied
- Updated `self-test-results.json` with first scored run
- Initialized `maturity-history.json` with baseline score
- eval-criteria.yaml — no changes needed (all criteria well-formed)

## ⏳ Pending Jay's Approval
1. Herald SOUL.md `author` → `creator` field fix (carried from 2026-02-20)
2. run.sh refactor to remove `claude --print` delegation

## 📈 Trends
- Previous run (2026-02-20-pm): Unscored (first run, no self-tests)
- This run: 72/100 — baseline established
- Consecutive all-pass: 1/5 needed for Level 2

## 🔧 eval-criteria Changes
- No changes this run

## 🎫 Issue Triage
- 0 open GitHub issues
- No new issues created (all tests passed)

## 📊 Maturity Score: 72/100 (Level 1)

Breakdown:
- self_test_pass_rate: 7/7 = 1.0 × 0.4 = **40**
- issue_resolution_rate: 0 issues = N/A → default 0.5 × 0.2 = **10**
- report_quality: All required sections present × 0.2 = **20**
- eval_criteria_evolution: No changes yet × 0.1 = **0**
- no_regression: No regression × 0.1 = **2** (partial — only 2nd run)

**Level 2 promotion: NOT YET** — Need score ≥ 80 and 5 consecutive all-pass runs (currently 1/5)
